\chapter*{Preface}

This is a lab notebook intended to give you experience solving
ordinary and partial differential equations numerically.  The
objectives of this course are 
\begin{itemize}
\item to help you learn how to solve a differential equation
  numerically; in situations when a paper-and-pencil solution is
  impossible or impractical.
\item to help you gain greater skills programming a computer and using
  loops, logic, functions, and classes.
\item that your ability to produce a high-quality, professional
  scientific document will increase.
\end{itemize}

Text with a bold P designation (\textbf{P1.1} for example) indicate tasks
that will be done together in class.  Text with a bold H designation
are homework problems and should be completed out of class. (working
in groups is encouraged.) 

Python is the programming language that we will be using You can
obtain a free copy of Python
\href{https://store.enthought.com/downloads/}{here}.  Any computer
code that you create should be uploaded to the Google Drive folder
provided.

There is a companion book to this one entitled, ``Introduction to
Python''.  It is intended to help you learn to use Python to do the
tasks contained herein.
